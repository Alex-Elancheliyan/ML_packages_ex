# Machine Learning Python Libraries 

## Overview

This repository contains workout files related to Python libraries used in machine learning, completed as part of the Machine Learning with Artificial Intelligence course at STC Skills. The workouts focus on practical implementation and usage examples of various libraries commonly used in machine learning projects.

## Libraries and Topics Covered

### Matplotlib

[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits.

- **Matplotlib_examples.py**: Contains examples demonstrating the usage of Matplotlib for creating various types of plots such as line plots, bar plots, histograms, and scatter plots.

### SciPy

[SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) is a scientific computing library that builds on NumPy and provides a large number of higher-level scientific algorithms. It aims to complement NumPy's functionality with functions that are useful in scientific and engineering applications.

- **Scipy_dataset_example.py**: Demonstrates how to work with datasets using SciPy, including loading datasets, data preprocessing, and basic statistical analysis.

### NumPy

[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

- **numpyexample.py** and **numpyexample2.py**: Contains examples showcasing the basic functionality of NumPy, such as array creation, manipulation, and basic operations.

### Additional Libraries

- **scipyexamples.py**: Includes additional examples demonstrating various functionalities of the SciPy library, such as optimization, interpolation, and signal processing.
